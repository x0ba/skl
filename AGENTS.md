## Coding Preferences - General

- Keep things simple. Channel "yagni" energy unless told otherwise.
- Typesafety is useful, take advantage of it where possible.
- Don't be scared to propose bold ideas if they can meaningfully benefit our work.
- Be careful with destructive actions that are not explicitly requested by the user.
- Tests are good! Endless smoke tests, "regression tests" for feature deletions, etc, much less good. Tests should be focused, not slop.
- Comments are a great way to clarify functionality and how code is used. Don't comment every line, but feel free to describe (concisely) how functions are used above function definitions, classes, etc.
- Keep comments up to date! When making changes, it's important to keep things in sync.

## Coding preferences - Typescript Focused
- any is the enemy. Inferred types are our friend. Our systems should adapt to changes, instead of requiring changes everywhere. 
- If your TS code looks like a Python dev wrote it, it is bad TS code. 
- Avoid one-line functions that are just casting wrappers.

## Questions are read-only

- A question is a request for an answer, not for changes. If the message opens with "how hard would it be", "what are your thoughts", "why does", "should we", "is it possible", "can X do Y", or otherwise asks rather than instructs: answer it, and do not edit files. 
- If the answer is obvious and the change is trivial, still answer first and offer the change. Ask before making it.

## Subagent use

- Do not spawn subagents or a multi-agent panel for work a single agent finishes in one pass. Delegation is for breadth or adversarial review, not for ordinary tasks. 
- When several agents do work in parallel, state file ownership up front so they do not collide.

## Design
- Do not edit real components first. For any non-trivial Ul, layout, or copy change, build several distinct static mocks, publish them with the `html-communication` skill, report the URL, and stop. Wait for a pick before implementing. 
- Standing constraints: Information-dense, no decorative card/pill chrome, no light-gray subtitle lines above sections. Minimal copy. No em dashes. 
- Avoid continuously repainting CSS animations (pulse, shimmer, blur, spinners); they peg the GPU on high-refresh displays.

## Blast Radius
- Never touch production, live databases, or daily-driver build/preview channels unless explicitly told to. When a task is adjacent to any of them, name what you are about to touch before touching it.

## Pull Requests
- When filing PRs, call the `file-pr` skill.
